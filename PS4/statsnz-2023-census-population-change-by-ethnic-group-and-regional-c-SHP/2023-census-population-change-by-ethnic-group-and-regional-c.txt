  **Footnotes**
  
  **Geographical boundaries**
  
  [Statistical standard for geographic areas 2023 (updated December
  2023)](https://www.stats.govt.nz/methods/statistical-standard-for-geographic-areas-2023/)
  has information about geographic boundaries as of 1 January 2023. Address data
  from 2013 and 2018 Censuses was updated to be consistent with the 2023 areas.
  Due to the changes in area boundaries and coding methodologies, 2013 and 2018
  counts published in 2023 may be slightly different to those published in 2013 or
  2018.
  
  ​
  
  **Subnational census usually resident population**
  
  The census usually resident population count of an area (subnational count) is a
  count of all people who usually live in that area and were present in New
  Zealand on census night. It excludes visitors from overseas, visitors from
  elsewhere in New Zealand, and residents temporarily overseas on census night.
  For example, a person who usually lives in Christchurch city and is visiting
  Wellington city on census night will be included in the census usually resident
  population count of Christchurch city.
  
  ​
  
  **Caution using time series**
  
  Time series data should be interpreted with care due to changes in census
  methodology and differences in response rates between censuses. The 2023 and
  2018 Censuses used a combined census methodology (using census responses and
  administrative data), while the 2013 Census used a full-field enumeration
  methodology (with no use of administrative data).
  
  ​
  
  **About the 2023 Census dataset**
  
  For information on the 2023 dataset see [Using a combined census model for the
  2023
  Census](https://www.stats.govt.nz/topics/using-a-combined-census-model-for-the-2023-census/).
  We combined data from the census forms with administrative data to create the
  2023 Census dataset, which meets Stats NZ's quality criteria for population
  structure information. We added real data about real people to the dataset where
  we were confident the people who hadn’t completed a census form (which is known
  as admin enumeration) will be counted. We also used data from the 2018 and 2013
  Censuses, administrative data sources, and statistical imputation methods to
  fill in some missing characteristics of people and dwellings.
  
  ​
  
  **Data quality**
  
  The quality of data in the 2023 Census is assessed using the quality rating
  scale and the quality assurance framework to determine whether data is fit for
  purpose and suitable for release. [Data quality assurance in the 2023
  Census](https://www.stats.govt.nz/methods/data-quality-assurance-in-the-2023-census)
  has more information.
  
  ​
  
  **Quality rating of a variable**
  
  The quality rating of a variable provides an overall evaluation of data quality
  for that variable, usually at the highest levels of classification. The quality
  ratings shown are for the 2023 Census unless stated. There is variability in the
  quality of data at smaller geographies. Data quality may also vary between
  censuses, for subpopulations, or when cross tabulated with other variables or at
  lower levels of the classification. [Data quality ratings for 2023 Census
  variables](https://www.stats.govt.nz/methods/data-quality-ratings-for-2023-census-variables)
  has more information on quality ratings by variable.
  
  ​
  
  **Ethnicity concept quality rating**
  
  Ethnicity is rated as high quality.
  
  [Ethnicity – 2023 Census: Information by
  concept](https://datainfoplus.stats.govt.nz/Item/nz.govt.stats/1f1ca131-a9aa-483b-98ab-d22bf84ae944)
  has more information, for example, definitions and data quality.
  
  ​
  
  **Using data for good**
  
  Stats NZ expects that, when working with census data, it is done so with a
  positive purpose, as outlined in the [Māori Data Governance
  Model](https://www.kahuiraraunga.io/maoridatagovernance) (Data Iwi Leaders
  Group, 2023). This model states that "data should support transformative
  outcomes and should uplift and strengthen our relationships with each other and
  with our environments. The avoidance of harm is the minimum expectation for data
  use. Māori data should also contribute to iwi and hapū tino rangatiratanga”.
  
  ​
  
  **Confidentiality**
  
  The 2023 Census confidentiality rules have been applied to 2013, 2018, and 2023
  data. These rules protect the confidentiality of individuals, families,
  households, dwellings, and undertakings in 2023 Census data. Counts are
  calculated using fixed random rounding to base 3 (FRR3) and suppression of
  ‘sensitive’ counts less than six, where tables report multiple geographic
  variables and/or small populations. Individual figures may not always sum to
  stated totals. [Applying confidentiality rules to 2023 Census data and summary
  of changes since 2018 and 2013
  Censuses](https://www.stats.govt.nz/methods/applying-confidentiality-rules-to-2023-census-data-and-summary-of-changes-since-2018-and-2013-censuses/)
  has more information about 2023 Census confidentiality rules.

  **Percentages**
  
  To calculate percentages, divide the figure for the category of interest by the
  figure for ‘Total stated’ where this applies.

       Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
       intended for use by those authorized to give the public
       permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
       copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
       irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
       and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
       Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
       applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
       material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
       material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
       licensed material, or material used under an exception or
       limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

       Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
       licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
       licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
       the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
       example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
       copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
       licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
       other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
       the licensed material may still be restricted for other
       reasons, including because others have copyright or other
       rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
       such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
       Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
       respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

  By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree

    h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
       under this Public License.
  
    i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or

       equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
  
    k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
       under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
  
  Section 2 -- Scope.
  
    a. License grant.
  
         1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
            the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
            non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
            exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
  
              a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                 in part; and
  
              b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
  
         2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
            Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
            License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
            its terms and conditions.
  
         3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
            6(a).
  
         4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
            Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
            all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
            and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
            Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
            authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
            necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
            technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
            Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
            simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
            (4) never produces Adapted Material.
  
         5. Downstream recipients.
  
              a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                 recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                 receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                 Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                 Public License.
  
              b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                 any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                 apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                 Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                 Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                 Material.
  
         6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
            may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
            are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
            with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
            the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
            provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
  
    b. Other rights.
  
         1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
            licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
            privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
            the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
            assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
            extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
            Rights, but not otherwise.
  
         2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
            Public License.
  
         3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
            collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
            Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
            under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
            licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
            reserves any right to collect such royalties.
  
  Section 3 -- License Conditions.
  
  Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
  following conditions.
  
    a. Attribution.
  
         1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
            form), You must:
  
              a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                 with the Licensed Material:
  
                   i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                      Material and any others designated to receive
                      attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                      the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                      designated);
  
                  ii. a copyright notice;
  
                 iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
  
                  iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                      warranties;
  
                   v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                      extent reasonably practicable;
  
              b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                 retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
  
              c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                 Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                 hyperlink to, this Public License.
  
         2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
            reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
            which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
            reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
            hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
            information.
  
         3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
            information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
            reasonably practicable.
  
         4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
            License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
            Material from complying with this Public License.
  
  Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
  
  Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
  apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
  
    a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
       to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
       portion of the contents of the database;
  
    b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
       contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
       Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
       Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
  
    c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
       all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
  
  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
  replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
  Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
  
  Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
  
    a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
       EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
       AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
       ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
       IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
       WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
       PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
       ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
       KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
       ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  
    b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
       TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
       NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
       INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
       COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
       USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
       ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
       DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
       IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  
    c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
       above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
       possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
       waiver of all liability.
  
  Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
  
    a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
       Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
       this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
       terminate automatically.
  
    b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
       Section 6(a), it reinstates:
  
         1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
            it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
            violation; or
  
         2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
  
       For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
       right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
       of this Public License.
  
    c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
       Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
       distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
       will not terminate this Public License.
  
    d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
       License.
  
  Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
  
    a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
       terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
  
    b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
       Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
       independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
  
  Section 8 -- Interpretation.
  
    a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
       shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
       conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
       be made without permission under this Public License.
  
    b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
       deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
       minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
       cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
       without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
       conditions.
  
    c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
       failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
       Licensor.
  
    d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
       as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
       that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
       processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
